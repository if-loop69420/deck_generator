<p>The canonical baseof a vector space [$]V[/$] is a subset [$]B\subset V[/$], that is not only a base  of [$]V[/$], but also has the following structure (each column is a vector):</p>
<p>[$]\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; ... &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; ... &amp; 0 \\\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; ... &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}[/$].</p>
